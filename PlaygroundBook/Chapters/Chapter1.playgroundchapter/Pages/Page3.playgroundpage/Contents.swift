//: # Clean The Ocean
//: Have you heard of The Great Pacific Garbage Patch? Is the largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the world. Is located between Hawaii and California. There are approximately 1.8 million pieces of plastic, weighing approximately 80,000 tons that were pushed by sea currents.
//:
//: One of the main causes of this ecological catastrophe is garbage thrown on the beach by people who do not know the consequences or do not care. But what are the consequences?
//:
//: Some of the consequences are:
//: * Damage to marine animals
//: * Water contamination
//: * Diseases proliferation
//:
//: Some bathers in this city have committed this irresponsible attitude. Help clean it by putting the trash in the trash cans.
//:
//: If you want to reset:
//: 1. Select the `resetGarbages()` function or just write it,
//: 2. Click on "Run My Code",
//: 3. See what happens. Any difference?
